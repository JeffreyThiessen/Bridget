3D Printable Files for SGF Bridget controller. The case is a modified version of the Flatbox rev4 by jfedor (https://github.com/jfedor2/flatbox). The buttons are a modified version of the Egg On Rice buttons by b1nc (https://github.com/b1nc/Egg-On-Rice-Controller). It is designed to fit a Flatbox rev4 PCB without modification.  
  
v1 of this case is no longer used. v2 was developed to increase rigidity, ease assembly, and allow for future additions. When assembling v2, tolerances are tight and may require a SMALL amount of pressure to seat the sides into other pieces. If the pieces do not snap together with small amounts of force, your printer/filament may need tuning to print the dimensions more accurately, or you may need to do some sanding. You can also always go back to printing v1.  
  
Each case requires the following for full assembly:  
1x top case  
1x bottom case  
2x sides - IMPORTANT NOTE - the portion of the side panel that seats into the top case is deeper than the portion that seats into the bottom case. If your case doesn't close without a gap, you probably have the side panel upside down.  
11x small button  
1x big button  
7x M2x3 or M2x4 heat set brass inserts (https://amazon.com/gp/product/B0B8GN63S2)  
7x M2x5 or M2x6 countersunk flat screws (https://amazon.com/gp/product/B0B54FHHDW)  
4x 6mm/0.25in bumpons (https://amazon.com/dp/B016GWHSBE)  
  
All parts can be printed without supports. You may or may not need a brim for the larger case pieces depending on how good your filament's bed adhesion is. Use the ideal layer height for your printer. For our production runs, these are printed with default Optimal settings for our printers in Bambu Lab. Use of a fast CoreXY printer like a Voron or Bambu is advised if you'd like to make them regularly, as they can take quite a while to print.
