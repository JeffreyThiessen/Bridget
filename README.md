3D Printable Files for SGF Bridget (flatbox rev4-based) controller

Each case requires the following for full assembly:
1x top case
1x bottom case
11x small button
1x big button
7x M2x3 or M2x4 heat set brass inserts (https://amazon.com/gp/product/B0B8GN63S2)
7x M2x5 or M2x6 countersuck flat screws (https://amazon.com/gp/product/B0B54FHHDW)
4x 6mm/0.25in bumpons (https://amazon.com/dp/B016GWHSBE)

All parts can be printed without supports face down on the build plate. You may or may not need a brim for the larger case pieces depending on how good your filament's bed adhesion is. Use the ideal layer height for your printer. For our production runs, these are printed with default Optimal settings for our printers in Bambu Lab. Use of a fast CoreXY printer like a Voron or Bambu is advised if you'd like to make them regularly, as they can take quite a while to print.
