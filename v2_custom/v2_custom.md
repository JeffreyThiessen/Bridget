These files work with files in v2/ and Buttons/

There are 2 versions of the custom buttons, with and without bevel. btn4 is for the top row 4th button and btn8 is for the bottom row 4th button.

top_hole_btn_fragment.stl is included for if you want to modify the regular v2 case with the round top button design without the custom button shapes.

For multicolour prints with cutouts, add pauses in your slicer settings after layer 2 and layer 5 to switch filaments back and forth. Have at least 3 layers of colour 2 for better results.

For best looking results with cutouts, set your supports to be as far from your build as possible while still being able to bridge the material. This way you will have less of the outerlayer colour melting into the 2nd colour.
