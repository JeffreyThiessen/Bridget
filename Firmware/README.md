# Bridget
Pre-compiled firmware for SGF Bridget controller. The case is a modified version of the Flatbox by jfedor (https://github.com/jfedor2/flatbox) running the GP-2040 CE firmware (https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/GP2040-CE).  The firmware only differs from the standard Flatbox firmware in some of the configuration defaults.
